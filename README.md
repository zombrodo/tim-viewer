# TIM Viewer

![](docs/screenshot.png)

This project contains a React-based viewer for the TIM image format. It's
currently a work in progress, but I'll add more details the further I get
through.

The most notable missing feature is that the 24-bit and 15-bit `pmode`s are
**not** implemented.

If you want to know more, [I've written a post about how you might go about
parsing one in Typescript](https://jackrobinson.co.nz/blog/tim-image-parsing/)
(which is what this uses under the hood!)
